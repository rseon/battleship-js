# Battle ship JS

> Play Battleship in CLI !

[Original idea](https://gist.github.com/lizparody/528badd08958943a7d309195b824f25d)

This is just a playground to play with ES6 and Node


## Install

You need NodeJS to play this game. And that's all.

- Download last release and unzip it
- Open a command prompt (CLI) in full screen
- Type `node cli.js`
- Enjoy !


### A note on command prompt

Please use a "modern" command prompt. An older (like the default Windows CLI) can't display Unicode characters.

This game has been tested on following CLI :

- Terminal (Windows 10)
- Git Bash (Windows 10)

If you have tested successfully on another CLI / OS, please add it to this list and send a pull request :)


## Develop

- Clone this project
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` (for hot reload)



## Roadmap

- [x] CLI mode
- [ ] Add preview in readme
- [ ] Better CLI graphics
- [ ] Browser version

Any idea ? Send pull request !
